# Ships,,,,,
cmc_basic,SHIP,"A wonderful refit of Vigilance. Using Funnels as the main power, Zhuji-class could beat most of frigates that couldn't handle the beam impact.",,,
cmc_doyinhammer,SHIP,"Despite its poor flux performance and mediocre armor, no one is immune to its fearsome firepower. As a hammerhead refit, it brings out the best in ship system. A fearsome large turret on the front can destroy any destoryers that tries to get in its way when the system is activated.",,,
cmc_fairyeagle,SHIP,"A refit of the most common and popular midline ship, eagle. Have to say, designers' creativity only goes so far. The shortage of knowledge brings about the brutal mounts design. Two large turrets can pose a great threat to the similar size of warships, and even more deadly to small hulls. As a price, its energy system is quite unstable. It is not so much the constraint of slot position as the extreme design itself.",,,
cmc_fairyark,SHIP,"Although it's called a combat carrier, most people don't think it has anything to do with common carriers. In the knowledge of the captains of the Celestial Mount Circle, it is the horn to charge forward.",,,
cmc_kunlun,SHIP,"A religious refit of Onslaught-class battleships,  which is the best kind of captial ship serving for CMC. Though Kunlun-class doesn't have medium turrets for equipping with high-performance weapons, four low-energy tpc could make up for these. It brings Kunlun the best front firepower, but makes it weaker in engine slots or both sides than any other captial ships.",,,
cmc_spiritforce,SHIP,"Equippied with low-energy phase lance, Spirit-Force is a common type of funnels that Celestial Mount Circle always produce and deploy. Due to the lack of a full grasp of its technology, Spirit-Force's aggressiveness is not strong, but that means it can ensure its own safety.",,,

#Worlds,,,,,
cmc_planet_yuanming,CUSTOM,"This is the base of Celestial Mount Circle, known as the ideal township. The planet is blessed with a large number of services debris, from which the essence of the circle cult was discovered.",,,
cmc_planet_mingyue,CUSTOM,"Yuan Ming's satellite, rich in mineral resources, is the base of Celestial Mount Circle in the galaxy.",,,
cmc,FACTION,"Celestial Mount Circle, although a derivative of the luddic church, is not a fundamentalist luddite group, who believes that people should give themselves back to nature, and in the same way, everything has a destination. The ultimate goal of the Circle is to ""mix the elements and unify them"", but they are confused in the process of expanding their territory, wondering why human being could not have an actual END. Not knowing what to do next they lived their primitive lives huddled in a small star system provided by the luddic church.",,,
